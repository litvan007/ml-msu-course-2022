The Boyenga Team are Real Estate Experts for Belle Haven Menlo Park Historically a quiet and affordable neighborhood east of the 101, Menlo Park’s Belle Haven was established during the 1930s and is known today for its proximity to the famous Silicon Valley company, Facebook. Belle Haven is still one of the most affordable neighborhoods on the Peninsula. One of the reasons is that most of the homes are single-story, small square footage structures on smaller lots that were originally designed for lower-income families as affordable housing in Menlo Park. Today, Belle Haven is seeing a resurgence of real estate interest, particularly for young buyers and young families that work for Facebook. With many of the homes in the “under $1.2 million” range, it has become a target neighborhood for many who would usually make their initial purchase a condo or townhome. One of the newest developments in Belle Haven is the Clarum Homes tract which was built in 2007 around the city’s Hamilton Park. Modeled after Sunset Magazine’s 2005 eco-friendly Idea House, these homes offer environmental amenities including solar panels and tankless water heaters and have very close proximity to the Facebook campus. Belle Haven’s amenities are many, including a community center that Facebook plans to aid in the renovation of in the near future, a community pool, a library, a few small shopping centers, and two parks. The Neighbors: Very diverse with residents from all kinds of backgrounds, professions, and lifestyles Unexpected Appeal: A community pool, two parks, and a library Team favorites: Lots of dog walking and bike riding What to expect: Small starter homes occupied by longtime residents and new home buyers The Lifestyle: A quiet neighborhood, one of the most affordable on the Peninsula The Commute: 15 minutes from Stanford University.
